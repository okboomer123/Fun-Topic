    <p style="font-size:201%;"> Many people use some sort of media even if its just the newspaper it could still be considered a media. I personally use Youtube, Discord, Steam, Reddit, and less often Origin, Epic Games, Instagram, and some others. I think the media I use the most on this list is the first four. I use these everyday and multiple hours a day too. I think these four that I use are fun to use and can be a learning experience in some way. On discord I can talk to my friends and other people I do not know. On Reddit I can learn about knew things and have a good laugh sometimes. On Steam I can use different available software to create a game or something along the lines of that. On youtube I can search how to do pretty much anything which can be helpful and has been helpful.

  <a href="https://discordapp.com/">Discord</a>
  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a>
  <br>
  For the second part Events Impact, I think an event that really shaped how I am today is when I finally had enough money to buy my own ipod 2nd generation which I bought from my local Target when I was 7 years old. This lead me into the world of many different types of media Like youtube and game center ultimately leading to my media uses today.
